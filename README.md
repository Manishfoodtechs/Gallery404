GALLERY404
====

A ThreeJS/webGL art gallery experiment. This repo holds a basic template that should teach you the basics of setting up a scene, loading models and positioning them where you want. Read the source code comments and refer to the three.js documentation <a href="http://threejs.org/docs/" target="_blank">here</a>. Simply upload your own files, edit their position/scale in the scene.js file in the 'js' folder (if desired), and run it! (from a website or local server).  


GALLERY404 is an ongoing web project from <a href="http://www.art404.com" target="_blank">art404</a> as an effort to bring art on the web to the next dimension. Their first show at GALLERY404 is now live <a href="http://www.gallery.art404.com" target="_blank"> here </a> as part of the <a href="http://thewrong.org/Welcome" target="_blank">The Wrong - New Digital Art Biennale</a>.
