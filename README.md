A ThreeJS/webGL art gallery experiment. This repo holds a basic template that should teach you the basics of setting up a scene, loading models and positioning them where you want. Read the source code comments and refer to the three.js documentation <a href="http://threejs.org/docs/" target="_blank">here</a>. Simply upload your own files, edit their position/scale in the scene.js file in the 'js' folder (if desired), and run it! (from a website or local server).
